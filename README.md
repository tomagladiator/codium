An alternativ way to code your website.
This is juste a concept so currently no software can compile this idea.

A way to code more easily and with a good flexibility.

Forget about `<p>` `<i>` `<a>` `<e>` `<b>` `<div>` `<article>` `<main>` `<header>` `<ul>` `<li>` ....

Here, you can custom yours elements like you wish:

    [ menu ]  
        [ menu-list ]  
            Lorem 01  
        [/ menu-list ]  
        [ menu-list ]  
            Lorem 02  
        [/ menu-list ]  
    [/ menu ]  

Every element is a [ block ]
And here a way to give them some goodies:
     
    [ top | class='dark' | data='$valeur' ]
    
    [/ top ]
    
Yeah you can pass some variable if you need.

Another exemple:

    [ pub | src='img/pub.png'| href='pub.html' | alt='For Free Pub' /]

A block can be a link, an image or BOTH!
